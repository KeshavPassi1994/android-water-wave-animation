# 🌊 WaveFlow — Android Water Wave Animation (Kotlin)

A modern **Android animation demo** built using **Kotlin**, showcasing a smooth water wave effect created with **Custom View**, **Canvas drawing**, and real-time animation rendering.

This project is part of a professional mobile development portfolio demonstrating advanced UI animation and custom drawing techniques in native Android.

---

## ✨ Features

* ✅ Custom Water Wave Animation
* ✅ Canvas & Path drawing
* ✅ Real-time animation rendering
* ✅ Smooth infinite motion
* ✅ Lightweight & high performance
* ✅ Pure Kotlin (No external animation libraries)
* ✅ Clean and readable code with professional comments

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This repository demonstrates how to build **custom animations from scratch** using Android’s native graphics system instead of relying on third-party libraries.

It showcases:

* Custom View development
* Canvas drawing techniques
* Mathematical animation (Sine wave motion)
* Performance-friendly UI rendering
* Advanced Android UI skills

Perfect for portfolio demonstration and client evaluation.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

The animation simulates moving water using a **sine mathematical function**:

* A custom `View` continuously redraws itself
* Canvas paths create the wave shape
* Offset values animate horizontal motion
* `postInvalidateOnAnimation()` ensures smooth frame updates

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Kotlin
* Android SDK
* Custom View
* Canvas API
* Path Drawing
* Mathematical Animation
